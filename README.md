#Recap:

In this Challenge, i had the opportunity to take on the role of an analyst at a high-tech investment firm. The task was to point out arbitrage oppotunities by sorting through historical trade data for Bitcoin on two exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase.

After reviewing data collected, prepararing it, and running a deep analysis, including visualizations, i discovered that as Bitcoin grew in popularity, the opportunities to capitalize on arbitrage opportunities decreased. It was challeging to find dates specially in the year 2019.
